## Elbow Motion Simulator

A biomechanical testing device designed to evaluate total elbow replacement implants using cadaveric specimens.


## Overview
This project addresses the need for standardized testing of elbow implants due to increasing elbow replacement surgeries. The simulator replicates human elbow biomechanics to test implant performance, durability, and safety for medical device manufacturers and healthcare professionals.

### Key Features:
- Replicates natural elbow range of motion (flexion, extension, pronation, supination)
- Load capacity up to 1kN
- Precision actuator control for smooth movement
- Chrome stainless steel construction for durability and corrosion resistance
- Uses cadaveric specimens for realistic testing conditions

## Design Specifications
- Range of Motion: Flexion (130-154°), Extension (-6 to 11°), Pronation (75-85°), Supination (80-104°)
- Load Capacity: Up to 1kN peak joint load
- Materials: Chrome stainless steel frame, natural rubber stabilizers
- Key Components: Linear actuators, rotary actuator, force sensors, specimen clamping system

## System Components
- Frame Structure: Chrome stainless steel frame with mounting posts
- Actuators: Linear actuators for flexion/extension, rotary actuator for pronation/supination
- Specimen Mount: Hinged clamping system with 90° access for specimen installation
- Stabilizers: Natural rubber components to prevent unwanted motion
- Monitoring: Force sensors for load measurement during testing

## Project Development
This project was developed using systematic engineering design methods:
- Planning: Work Breakdown Structure, Gantt charts, Critical Path Method
- Requirements: Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to translate customer needs
- Concept Selection: Go/No-Go screening matrix for design evaluation
- Design Tools: SolidWorks CAD modeling and analysis

## Results
The final design successfully meets all specified requirements:
- Accurately replicates human elbow biomechanics
- Handles required 1kN load capacity
- Provides standardized platform for elbow implant testing
- Meets medical device testing requirements for safety and precision

## Future Improvements
- Add triceps simulation actuator for more realistic extension
- Enhanced supination mechanism with additional actuators
- Modular design for easier maintenance and disassembly
- Multiple humerus clamping points for better stability
